Tasks

Learn about potential useful functions
Setup interfaces and functions
Learn specific knowledge and try challenges

Potentially useful interfaces and functions:
- VertexInput/VertexOutput
- Command encoder function with an interface
  - Command encoder function
    - Loops over provided array of interfaces, performing proper setup
  - Interface
    - Pipeline
    - Texture
    - Vertix count
    - Render pass descriptor
  - This might relie on other things, but we'll get there when we need to.
