# Jabberwocky

Jabberwocky website

Work-in-progress. Check back even later... 
Also, watch out, my lighting algorithm (if it can even be called one yet) could potentially cause epilepsy. Again, it's not ready yet.

If you still want a peek, clone the repo, install npm and yarn, and run `yarn install` and then `yarn serve`.

## Roadmap

- Improved installation process planned for the future.
- Improved converter from archive to website.
- Improved component modularization.
- Converting around seven to eight different particle-effect-based components from design to code.
