# Jabberwocky

Jabberwocky website

Work-in-progress. Check back after this weekend!

If you still want a peek, clone the repo, install npm and yarn, and run `yarn install` and then `yarn serve`. 

## Roadmap

Improved installation process planned for the future.
Improved converter from archive to website.
Improved component modularization.
Converting around seven to eight different particle-effect-based components from design to code.
